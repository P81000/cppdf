# cppdf

**Status**: Work in progress

This project aims to read and render PDF files directly in the terminal. The idea is to use `libpoppler` for PDF handling and possibly `libsixel` for rendering images in the terminal.

Build with `make` using the provided `Makefile`.  
Currently, only basic structure is in place, and development is ongoing.
